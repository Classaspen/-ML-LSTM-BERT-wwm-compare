# -ML-LSTM-BERT-wwm-compare
This repository is used for the experimental reports in the undergraduate machine learning course. The specific content involves comparing the performance of LSTM and BERT-wwm models on sentiment analysis of e-commerce reviews. The dataset used in the experiments will also be uploaded.

Among them, LSTM.py is the implementation code for the LSTM model, which is usable in a Python 3.9 environment. BERT-wwm.py is the implementation code for the BERT model. If you wish to use it locally, you need to install the Hugging Face (Transformers) library. Alternatively, you can directly use it online via Colab. I used the second method, which is more convenient.
