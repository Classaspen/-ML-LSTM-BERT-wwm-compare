# -ML-LSTM-BERT-wwm-compare
This repository is used for the experimental reports in the undergraduate machine learning course. The specific content involves comparing the performance of LSTM and BERT-wwm models on sentiment analysis of e-commerce reviews. The dataset used in the experiments will also be uploaded.

Among them, LSTM.py is the implementation code for the LSTM model, which is usable in a Python 3.9 environment. BERT-wwm.py is the implementation code for the BERT model. If you wish to use it locally, you need to install the Hugging Face (Transformers) library. Alternatively, you can directly use it online via Colab. I used the second method, which is more convenient.

The `saved_model` folder contains the output from running `LSTM.py`. The `dataset` folder stores the data used in this experiment, although only `LSTM_data.csv` is actually useful (lol). However, if you'd like to use other datasets, here are some additional datasets related to cameras, phones, cars, and laptops. Feel free to use them—you're welcome。
